# Telemetry System for TLM03e and TLM04e

In automotive racing, every second counts when it comes to winning a race. If the pilot brakes too early or makes too wide of a turn, they risk being overtaken and loosing the advantage. Thus, it is of major interest to be aware of how the vehicle behaves on track. In professional automotive sports, such as Formula 1 and MotoGP, the teams resort to the use of telemetry to improve machine and rider performance. 
This project refers to the telemetry system developed for an electric racing motorcycle prototype, built by Portuguese students at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST). 
[TLMoto](https://tlmoto.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) is a team made of students, mainly from IST, which is dedicated to projecting, building and racing electric motorcycles for international competitions around the world, like the one shown in the figure bellow.


This telemetry system is equipped with various sensors and communicates with the other sub-systems within the motorcycle, in order to collect and log as much information as possible. This piece of equipment has allowed the team at TLMoto to better understand the behavior of the prototype, advise the rider and also to troubleshoot other parts of the vehicle.





## What is telemetry?
Telemetry is the measurement of data from a distant object or vehicle, and, in many cases, the transmission of those measurements to a ground-station or database. However, all the competitions (like MotoStudent :tm:, Moto Engineering Italy:tm:, etc.) prohibit the use of live telemetry data transmission, as is the case of the professional MotoGP. As stated on the official regulation documents of those competitions, the telemetry data obtained from the prototype must only be acquired during pit-stops. 

The telemetry acquisition is a very important sub-system of the prototype, as it allows the team to have an accurate description of its behaviour in tests and races, as well as to provide feedback and suggestions to the pilot. It also plays a big roll in understanding what could be altered on the current prototype or what could be improved on the next one.
